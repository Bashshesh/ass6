# ass6
it is Assignment 6 for my university

Graphs
In this assignment you are asked to implement BFS and Djakstra for Edge-weighted graph with Vertex instead of Edge.

How these everything will be changed? Provide your own implementation for classes:  Vertex, WeightedGraph, Search, BreadthFirstSearch, DijkstraSearch and Main (with example usage) 

So it is my project, i do this all classes and provide all examples of usages

I have already two types of Graphs

WeightedGraph
Weighted graphs are commonly used in various algorithms and applications. For example, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph, where the weights represent distances or costs. Minimum spanning tree algorithms like Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are used to find the optimal set of edges that connect all vertices in a weighted graph with minimum total weight.

BFS
In the above implementation, the Vertex class is updated to use a Map to store the adjacent vertices with their corresponding weights. The WeightedGraph class maintains a map of vertices and their adjacent vertices. The Search interface defines the contract for the search algorithms, and the BreadthFirstSearch and DijkstraSearch classes implement the Search interface for BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm, respectively. The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory.
